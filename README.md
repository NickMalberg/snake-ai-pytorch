# Torch based Neural Network for playing a simple snake game

In this Python Reinforcement Learning Experiment I use the repository from [Patrik Loeber](https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch) and try to add some changes to the snake game itself like no walls, etc. 
and change the model intake from a simple 11 dimensions vector to the complete game layout, so the NN will "see" the whole game each iteration.
